// Number of Recent Calls Problem

// Question : You have a RecentCounter class which counts the number of recent requests within a certain time frame.
// Implement the RecentCounter class:
// RecentCounter() Initializes the counter with zero recent requests.
// int ping(int t) Adds a new request at time t, where t represents some time in milliseconds, 
// and returns the number of requests that has happened in the past 3000 milliseconds (including the new request). 
// Specifically, return the number of requests that have happened in the inclusive range [t - 3000, t].
// It is guaranteed that every call to ping uses a strictly larger value of t than the previous call.

// constraints :
// 1 <= t <= 109
// Each test case will call ping with strictly increasing values of t.
// At most 104 calls will be made to ping.


class RecentCounter {
    
    constructor(){
        this.counter;

// Complement of Base 10 Integer Problem

// Every non-negative integer N has a binary representation.  For example, 5 can be represented as "101" in binary, 11 as "1011" in binary, and so on.  
// Note that except for N = 0, there are no leading zeroes in any binary representation.
// The complement of a binary representation is the number in binary you get when changing every 1 to a 0 and 0 to a 1.  
// For example, the complement of "101" in binary is "010" in binary.
// For a given number N in base-10, return the complement of it's binary representation as a base-10 integer.
